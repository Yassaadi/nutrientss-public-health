#Yassine ASSAADI: French Public health data
# Objective
In this mission, our objective is to assess the viability of utilizing French public health dataset for the development of a nutrient tracking application. VEITRACK is my suggestion of a food tracking app specifically designed for vegans and vegetarians, which allows users to input their nutrient intake and monitor their daily and weekly requirements for essential nutrients.
# Context
According to multiple studies, vegan and vegetarian diets have been associated with a potential risk of nutrient deficiencies. To ensure a successful diet, individuals following vegan or vegetarian lifestyles should carefully monitor their daily food intake and ensure they meet the requirements for essential nutrients.
